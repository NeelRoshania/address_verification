About
	- PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
	
Installation procedures
	- run setup.sh
	- test installation
		- sudo -u postgres psql
		- The only user who can connect to a fresh install is the postgres user
  	- switch to user postgres and database postgres
		- postgres: sudo -u postgres psql postgres (probably looks for user in less etc/passwd
		- new roles: psql -U developer mydb
	- define roles and privaleges
		- user postgres is the default superuser, select * from pg_roles;
		- [required] - create a user that is not a super user for development, not a good idea to log in as a root user
		- [optional] - create a database of the current linux user to run psql without specifying database name

usage
	- connect to database; psql mydb
	- connect to database from user; psql -U posgres -W
	- run script in psql; \i script.sql
	- help -> all psql commands
	- information schema
		- https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/22362/list-all-columns-for-a-specified-table
	- restart server, sudo service postgresql restart 

Connections and authentication 
 	- get hosts are allowed to connect, how clients are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use,
    		- sudo vim etc/postgresql/15/main/pg_hba.conf
 	- configuration set on server startup (including connections and authentication)
    		- vim etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf

Troubleshooting

 psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
 Is the server running locally and accepting
 connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
 
	- sudo service postgresql restart
